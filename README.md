#  Strava Fitness Data Analysis

This project analyzes real-world fitness data collected from the Strava app using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. The goal is to uncover patterns in user behavior related to steps, calories, sleep, and activity levels.

---

##  Objective

To explore how physical activity (steps, very active minutes) affects calorie burn and sleep, and derive meaningful health insights from daily fitness tracking data.

---

##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Key Insights

- **Steps vs Calories** show a strong positive correlation (~0.59).
- **Very Active Minutes vs Sleep Duration** shows weak or no correlation.
- Most users average **6â€“8 hours of sleep**, with room for improvement.
- Users walking more tend to burn significantly more calories.
